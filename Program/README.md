The original code for flask-video-streaming is not from me but came from the article [video streaming with Flask](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/video-streaming-with-flask) and its follow-up [Flask Video Streaming Revisited](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/flask-video-streaming-revisited).

It turned out the above is just way easier than struggling with video-streaming in wxglade. It also means we can login with our phone and run the Pi headless :)
