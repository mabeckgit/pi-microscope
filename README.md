# pi-microscope

The pi-microscope is a hobby project of mine where I design and program a digital microscope based on a Raspberry Pi to run the application together with the Raspberry Pi camera module. The macro-lens is the spare lens from the [Foldscope project](https://www.foldscope.com/), which in itself is amazing and you should check it out. The hardware are 3d-printed parts that allow me together with some stepper motors to move the camera around. 

The bill of materials is not complete, yet, as the project is still under development and I am currently using stepper motors I salvaged out of an old fax machine -- so not really off the shelf material. Once the design is polished I will list a full bill of materials here. Here is what I have used so far: 
* [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)
* [2 Adafruit motor controller HATs] (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dc-and-stepper-motor-hat-for-raspberry-pi)
* [A Pololu DRV8825 Stepper Motor Driver] (https://www.pololu.com/product/2133)
* 3 stepper motors (

Similarly the list of CAD drawings is not complete, as I will likely have to adjust the frame to off the shelf motors. I will update the drawing files as I go along, maybe you can find some use in these. Eventually I will also explain how things fit together.
